This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The performance becomes extremely slow and choppy, especially when scrolling. The problem is that FlatList is re-rendering all items even when they are not visible in the viewport, leading to unnecessary calculations and rendering operations.  The following code snippet demonstrates a potential scenario:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({item}) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

Where `largeDataset` is an array containing thousands of items and `ItemComponent` renders complex UI elements.
