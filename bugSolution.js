The solution involves using two key props of the FlatList component:

*   `removeClippedSubviews`: Set to `true` to improve performance by removing items that are off-screen.
*   `initialNumToRender`: Set to a value that represents an appropriate number of items to initially render, reducing initial load time.

Here's the improved code:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({item}) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  removeClippedSubviews={true}
  initialNumToRender={10} // Adjust as needed
/>
```

By setting `removeClippedSubviews` to `true`, FlatList will only render the items that are currently visible.  Adjusting `initialNumToRender` helps fine-tune the initial rendering performance.  Experiment with different values for `initialNumToRender` to find the best balance between initial render time and perceived performance.
